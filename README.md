### Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
 - This application is designed to be an inventory application. I decided to try to make an application where a user and their family could keep track of the food that they had at home so that it was easy to make shopping trips, so they could know at a glance what they ran out of, and how much of something they had so they could check to see if they had enough for a recipe, ideally it would have automatically generated shopping lists for them as well.

### What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
 - The application required a log in screen, a main screen that displayed a grid of inventory that was stored in a database, and a pop up notification to request SMS permissions, and the fully developed application would have also included a screen to display an automatically generated list of items they had run out of.

### How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
 - I started with designing the UI, the screens and what they would look like then going piece by piece through the screens to write code to support the functionality.

### How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
 - Testing code is always imnportant, don't want app crashes when it reaches the user or unexpected behavior, in this case potentially making it so that 1 user accidentally logs into another's account or that it said they were out of something when they aren't which might end up costing the user extra money. The best times to test code, I think are on the endpoint of each screen, that way you can test the functionailty of each screen. Running the application when not every function is built might have caused unexpected behavior as so much of it is tied together.

### Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
 - There was a lot that I didn't know going into this project and getting creative with the code is half the fun of development. So there was a lot of experimentation and research to get certain functions to function

### In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
 - I think the part that I did best was the login screen, though, to be honest, all of it still needs a lot of work. I look forward to continueing to work on this app.
